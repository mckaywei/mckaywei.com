Hi, I'm **McKay Wei**, a designer & developer live in Sydney, AU. I'm tough - a geek with six packs. I write blog and make workout [videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7jxHwT7b7RJDmV4fyhl0HqNsYrqFAhtM) when I don't feel like working. If you wanna meet me in person, I'm a handshakes guy. If you wanna give me a million dollars, a small check would be nice. If you enjoy what I wrote, shoot me a tweet or drop me a comment. I'd love to hear from you.

The site 'mckaywei.com' is a personal weblog, where I put down some words longer than 140 characters. It's completely static - using Jekyll generates every page to HTML file, so the pages load real fast. Also without using a database there's no more security concern like it used to be in CMSs. My host is [Linode](http://mckaywei.com/post/mckayweicom-is-now-on-linode/). All of the content on this site is made available at no charge. Please do not repost the entire content of any article without asking first.
