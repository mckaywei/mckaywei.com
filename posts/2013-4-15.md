As a runner, my heart go out to you Boston, all the way from Sydney!

Today, two bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three (include one Chinese girl) and wounding dozens more. I'm wondering why would anybody, or any group of people had the twisted motivation to commit this attack. As soon as I heard the news I started checking Twitter. A White House official, lawmakers, and most major news networks are referring to the incident as an 'act of terror.' Police do not yet have a suspect in custody. We may know or may not know the answer by the next morning. But one thing is clear: whoever chose one of the world's greatest distance running events for both amateurs and professionals as the target of a terrorist attack will most certainly not convince me to stop running.

I've never been to Boston, but as an amateur marathon runner there's a sentiment floating around me. 

>The vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We’d have eaten ourselves alive long ago.

>So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, “The good outnumber you, and we always will.”

I'm not writing an essay. I can't really omit the reason why I started running. In the fall of 2012 I started workout seriously trying to put on some muscle. Meanwhile I put on my sneakers run a little bit about 10Km once a while to burn some fat. It felt good, my feet were alive, my lungs were alive. And then I did Sydney half-marathon 2012. This aliveness remains something that I cannot take for granted, a million nerves and muscle fibers to be thankful for and to regard as tiny miracles in themselves.

Whats vital? To me is the spirit of human endurance, the celebration of a feat as dedicated and unnatural as spending 22Km on my feet running against a clock for no reason other than that I believe in myself. It's not about running a half-marathon in one or two hours, it's about running it at all. Whoever set off those bombs in Boston won't stop our fellow marathoners from running. We don't live in fear. We do this to challenge ourselves, to support and remember those less fortunate than ourselves.

I'm going to run the Sydney Marathon 2013 this year!
