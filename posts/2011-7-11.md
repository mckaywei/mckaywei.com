MacBook Air 2011 comes with a nice little USB Restore key. It contains OS X Snow Leopard and iLife 2011. But with OS X Lion coming out soon, I found it is bit wasted for keeping it as an OS X Snow Leopard restore key. Wouldn't be cool if I can unlock and format the USB drive to use it as a normal USB drive or to restore it to Lion?!

Since Apple states this USB drive `read` only, not even Disk Utility can do the job to unlock it. I tried to google the solution, only found lots people trying to do the same thing with their USB, but none of them has achieved. Eventually I went into a Chinese website and find this formatting tool [慧荣格式化工具](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dg8gohc7sg4uxiu/index.html) (Windows only). So I borrowed a "PC" from my flatmate to continue the work.

* Plug in my MacBook Air USB
* Install and open the magic formatting tool  

Well, I'm not going to complain about its UI as long as it's working.

If you don't read Chinese just do what I did, select `F` drive and choose `Initialize: Public Only (1-Lun)`, then hit the button the one says **`格式化`**. When the processing bar goes to the end it will ask you to re-plug the USB drive. Do what it says.

To use the USB drive between Mac and PC I reformat the USB drive to `exFat` format. Not done yet, I noticed the original USB icon was gone. It's easy to fix:

* Download the [icon file](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/787ik375n76f7vm/index.html)
* Open it in Preview
* Press `command+a` to select all icon
* Right click the USB drive to `Get info`
* Click the icon at upper left corner press `command+v`  to paste icon file

There you go, a nice little read and writable Apple USB drive hands on.

###Performance 
The test results wasn't so bad. ![<Alt>](<http://cdn.mckaywei.com/post-img/aja-test.jpg>"AJA-test")
12.5 MB/sec and 19.8 MB/sec, respectively. 

###Verdict
This 8GB good looking Apple USB is now fully capable to be my day-to-day USB drive. 

**Q** Do I really need an extra USB drive for day-to-day tasks?

**A** The answer is NO! I don't use any USB drive often.

**Q** So what am I going to do with this "good looking" USB drive?

**A** I think I will keep using it as Restore Key for my Macs, every time Apple release a new version of OS X I will `Restore` the DMG file into this USB drive to keep it fresh.

> Thoughts? Is this something you would do with your MacBook Air Restore Key?
