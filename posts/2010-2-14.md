Some part of me is a geek / Otaku (お宅). Lack of social ability rather staying at home on the weekend day and night. I have friends come around trying to take me out have some fun, but for the most of the time after a routine-like struggle I end up with staying at home doing my thing on my computer. So eventually I came up some script to simplelize and functionlize my weekend planning process.

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code>if($tdy == (sat||sun))
	{
		while(!$sleeping);
		takeNap();
	}</code>
</pre>
</div>

That was the every first version. Then I got a girlfriend, things are getting more complex ever since.

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code>if($tdy == sat)
	{
		hangOut($weather, $mood, $condition);
		echo'What a day!';
		takeNap();
	}
	else if ($tdy == sun)
	{
		echo'WTF! Tomorrow is Monday?!';
		takeNap();
	}
	
function hangOut($weather, $mod, $condition);
	{
		if$weather == 'sunny'
		{
			echo 'weather check! Let's go to the beach.';
			tweet('Good day all! I'm off to the beach!'); backToSleep(1hr);getUp(1hr);getReady(1hr);
			$ppl[0,1] = 'myself', 'my gf';
			if($mod > 60)
			{
				$destination <= 100km;
				}
			else{
				$destination == 'cafe at the street corner';
				}
			echo 'Let's call some of your friends and see if anyone wanna join us.';
		if($frdJ = 'sleeping')
		{
			$ppl[2] = 'frdJ';
			$ppl[3] = 'the girl with frdJ';
		}
		else{
			 echo 'part time job?! Mehhh..';
		}
			echo 'you need a new bikini!';
			outToBeach();
			goHome();
		}
		else
		{
			echo 'should have stayed at home, so lame hanging at the beach';
		}
	}</code>
</pre>
</div>

So, this's the program I use to plan for my weekend.
