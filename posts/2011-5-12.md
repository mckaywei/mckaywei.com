For the some of you who don't know what Twitter for Mac secret menu is. Back to the age before [Tweetie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie) was acquired by Twitter I was one of the [MacHeist](http://macheist.com/) bundle-buyers. Needless to say we didn't get what we waited for, instead of Tweetie 2 we saw the official Twitter for Mac client debuted on App Store for free.

###Story behind

Here comes the best part. MacHeist didn't let us down, though. We received an email from MacHeist to be infoed that Twitter for Mac has some kind secret easter egg, which are only available to bundle buyers or whoever is reading this article. The image shows below is the Secret menu I unlocked from the latest version of [Twitter for Mac 2.1.1](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12), just to show you the method I provided is still working.

As you can see the Secret menu gives you a lot more option to use this client. My favourite parts are "Type anywhere", "Show full names", and change "Quote Syntax" to `RT @{USERNAME}: {TEXT}`.

###Hacking

There're a lot methods online need you to use several different Termianl commands to trigger these secret option. But my way is to fully unlock this menu in Twitter for Mac's Preference menu.

*  Quit Twitter for Mac
*  Open `Terminal`, which is located in your `/Applications/Utilites/` folder
*  Copy and paste these two commands in Terminal individually

######*Note*: The string value I put after `reg.email3` is my personal email address. For `reg.license3` what I used is the Serial number I got when I purchased the Bundle. If you were one of the bundle-buyers you can use your own email address and serial number as well! 

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code>defaults write com.twitter.twitter-mac reg.email3 -string "mckaywei@gmail.com"</code>
<code>defaults write com.twitter.twitter-mac reg.license3 -string "macheist-pants-snort-cake-29102699"</code>
</pre>
</div>
	
* Open Twitter for Mac, press `ctrl + opt + cmd` ( *Same keys used to use to trigger the Secret menu in Tweetie 2* )

That's it, check your Preference menu you should be able to see the Secret menu now.

**Happy hacking! Enjoy >_**

###Wonder how?

Let's explore a little bit more of how `defaults write` tweaks on OS X. 

Hopefully you've seen and used `defaults` commands before. What it does is allowing user to read, write, and delete OS X user preferences from a command-line shell (e.g `/bash` and `/zsh`). The `defaults` command is followed by ( `read`, `write`, `delete` ) + **domain** + **key** + `value`. Which is also the structure I used in those two commands.

**DOMAIN** It's not hard to find domain ( not the domain name we type in the browser address bar ). Dig deep via `/Applications/Twitter.app/Contents/info.plist` I find this:

	<dict>
			<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
			<string>Editor</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
			<string>com.twitter.twitter-mac</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>twitter</string>
			</array>
	</dict>
		
*Note: It'd be a lot easier to read if you open it in Xcode.*

**KEY** The hardest part to figure it out if you don't have any App Dev background. Me neither tho. In the past, locating these hidden preferences involved going through binary code of the application and searching for readable `string`, and then guessing how they might work. The old fashion is no longer work for us after Mac OS X 10.6 came out. Then we turn to GNU debugger, we use it to debug the application's running processes and find out what strings it uses. So the next thing I did is quitting the Twitter for Mac and opening my Terminal starts `gdb` this path `/Applications/Twitter.app/Contents/MacOS/Twitter`, then relaunch Twitter for Mac, it launches slower the usual after I run the command.

Now I can chill a little, make myself a coffee and wait. Click around in the Twitter for Mac Preferences menu, checks all the preference settings in that GUI. Let the app run for a while and then quit Twitter for Mac. The results shows me a long list of preferences and domains. I put the results in a text editor and try to search key word `email`. Below is the preferences and domains it's followed by contains `email` and `license`:

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code>reg.email3;kCFPreferencesCurrentApplication</code>
<code>reg.license3;kCFPreferencesCurrentApplication</code>
</pre>
</div>
	
The results before the semicolon are the keys I need, after are the domains. But I guess for some reason the domain doesn't always look like `com.twitter.twitter-mac`. I'm not an App developer so I don't know why, but I do know `kCFPreferencesCurrentApplication` indicates a preference that applies only to the current application, and `kCFPreferencesAnyApplication` indicates a preference that applies to any application after I checked [Mac Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFPreferencesUtils/Reference/reference.html).

**VALUE** The value didn't come free, but since it has no other use I don't might to share.

My email address is the string value for the key `reg.email3`; and the serial number is the string value for `reg.license3`.

Job done!

###つづく
I didn't go too deep about how to use GDB to find hidden preferences in any applications. I will probably write about more details in the next post. Stay tuned!
